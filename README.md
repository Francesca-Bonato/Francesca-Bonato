Welcome to my GitHub! I'm Francesca, a PhD in Chemistry & Applied Sciences who has transitioned into Software and Web Development. Through self-study and completing a 6-month coding Bootcamp at Develhope Academy, I built a strong foundation in both frontend and backend technologies. Currently, I work as a Frontend Developer specializing in React and TypeScript, with a particular focus on microfrontend architecture.

I thrive on solving problems.
